## Python - Everything is object

![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/252/r_208403_QPSN8.jpg)

Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, letâ€™s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:
```bash
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>> 
```
OK. But what about this?
```bash
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>> 
```

## General
```python
Why Python programming is awesome
What is an object
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
What is a reference
What is an assignment
What is an alias
How to know if two variables are identical
How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
What is mutable and immutable
What are the built-in mutable types
What are the built-in immutable types
How does Python pass variables to functions

## .txt files should:
```python
only one line
No Shebang
end with a new line
```
